I just finished a group project at the university where we need to develop a custom WordPress site for our client Townsville & Thuringowa Country Music Association. The task is to develop a custom theme by applying our skills in HTML, CSS, and PHP and enhancing our communication skills for project management.

I oversee the front-end design of our website, with my HTML and CSS experience. I am able to balance out the user interface to be user-friendly and apply the requirements of our client for their site. I encountered several design problems to pick between the design and functionality of the site, I can use the good practices for good web design to stay on the goal of the site.

I tackled various deployment issues, which made me turn around my deployment to using Docker over Vagrant. This strategy is to make it easier to set up a separate testing branch on their own machine. Preventing conflicts also increases my workflow and builds up efficiency. I gained more knowledge improving my management of project workflow.

Using VS Code as the main code editor for web designing together with Github for version control to manage and keep track of the changes on all the branches. This improved my cooperation skills and reinforced the necessity of collaboration in the workplace.

This project allowed me to build on my existing knowledge of deployment, staging, and the Git version control automation process by creating distinctly client-focused content. Concentrating on the criteria and understanding them by utilizing the website.

Overall, this project was a fantastic learning experience that enhanced my communication skills and technical abilities to follow project workflows, preparing me for future opportunities in the same industry. I feel like this project will be the stepping stone for more similar projects to improve my skills and knowledge of web designing and make myself a useful asset in future collaborative contexts.
